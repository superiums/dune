#### Releases
To get the current release build, install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/dune).

```bash
# Also works for updating dune
cargo install -f dune
```
_Currently, since Dune is in its early stages of development, I would recommend against using releases at the moment. There are a lot of bug fixes and new features added inbetween releases._

#### After Install

```bash
# Just run the dune executable!
dunesh
```
